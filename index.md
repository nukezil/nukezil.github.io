Currently, I am a Ph.D. student of [School of Computer Science, Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm). I consider myself extremely fortunate to be pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Yinghuan Shi](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/shiyh/index.htm). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Nanjing University in 2020.

<!-- My research interests primarily focus on machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, I am dedicated to developing efficient and robust learning methods for real-world vision applications. -->
