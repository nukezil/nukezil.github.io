<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

Currently, I am a PhD student of [School of Computer Science, Nanjing University](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm). I consider myself extremely fortunate to be pursuing my PhD degree under the supervision of [Prof. Yinghuan Shi](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/shiyh/index.htm). I am also a member of the [Reasoning and Learning Research Group](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/) led by [Prof. Yang Gao](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/gaoyang/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Nanjing University in 2020.

My research interests are currently centered on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and AI for Science. More specifically, I am dedicated to developing data-efficient learning methods for real-world applications across general vision, medicine, chemistry, and materials science.
